All the infections that the sun sucks up
From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him
By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me
And yet I needs must curse. But theyll nor pinch,
Fright me with urchinshows, pitch me i the mire,
Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark
Out of my way, unless he bid em; but
For every trifle are they set upon me;
Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me
And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which
Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount
Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I
All wound with adders who with cloven tongues
Do hiss me into madness.

Hey, I could go on and on and on 
I could explain every natural phenomenon
The sun, the stars, the clouds
That was just Maui messing around
I killed an eel, I buried its guts
It sprouted a tree, now you got coconuts
Whats the lesson what is the takeaway
Dont mess with Stroud when hes on a breakaway
