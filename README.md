# CodeCompetitions

Code from the various coding competitions that I attend

## Layout

Code is in [`src/`](https://github.com/funnyboy-roks/CodeCompetitions/tree/main/src)
directory.

2 root packages:

- [`com.funnyboyroks.practice`](https://github.com/funnyboy-roks/CodeCompetitions/tree/main/src/com/funnyboyroks/practice)
  - Competitions that we practice with after class
- [`com.funnyboyroks.real`](https://github.com/funnyboy-roks/CodeCompetitions/tree/main/src/com/funnyboyroks/real)
  - Competitions that we attend

The actual package name should be formatted as `com.funnyboyroks.<practice|real>._YYYY_MM_DD`, like the practice
competition on 9 Sept 2021 is called [`com.funnyboyroks.practice._2021_09_09`](https://github.com/funnyboy-roks/CodeCompetitions/tree/main/src/com/funnyboyroks/practice/_2021_09_09).

Inside this package, there will be several files for each problem that we solve, since they must be submitted as
individual files.
